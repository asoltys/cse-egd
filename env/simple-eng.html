					</h1>
				<div class="smallFont" style="font-weight:bold; float:right; padding-left:10px; width:350px;">
					<img src="../images/keeping-it-simple-1.jpg" alt="A visitor is gently escorted out of the dock before ship repairs begin. " width="350" height="229" /><br />
					Before the installation of the bubble curtain, seals would often
					find their way into the Esquimalt Graving Dock. Here, a visitor is gently
					escorted out of the dock before ship repairs begin. </div>
				<p>The new bubble curtain at the Esquimalt Graving Dock is saving hundreds
					of salmon and keeping shipyards running smoothly.</p>
				<p>The <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>-owned dock in Victoria, <acronym title="British Columbia">BC</acronym>, is a world-class water vessel repair
					facility. At over 350 metres long (the length of three football
					fields) and nearly 50 metres wide, it is wider than the Panama
					Canal and can accommodate 90 per-cent of existing ocean vessels.
					PWGSC leases space to private shipyards, which work on BC
					Ferries, cruise ships, and other vessels. About 70 ships
					come in and out every year.</p>
				<h2>Unwanted Visitors </h2>
				<p>Up until recently, the challenge was the uninvited guests that came in
					with the ships when they entered the dock. When the water
					was drained, dozens of fish and the odd seal were being trapped
					inside, stranded on the dock floor.</p>
				<p>Seals had to be coaxed into a first aid basket, and lifted by a crane
					over the dock walls to be released back into the ocean.</p>
				<p>&quot;It was quite an ordeal getting them out,&quot; says Daryl Lawes, PWGSC Environmetnal
					Coordinator, Environmetnal Services Directorate in Victoria.</p>
				<p>&quot;They would bite and snap at the brooms used, and up to six dock
					employees would be needed to rescue them.&quot;</p>
				<p>The bigger problem was the fish. Mr Lawes says that a local anglers
					association was releasing salmon into the nearby marina,
					and fish restoration efforts in the harbour and adjacent
					rivers led to a significant increase in fish activity. The
					grey graving dock simply looked like a river mouth to the
					salmon, and attracted them in droves.</p>
				<p>Aftter the dock water was pumped out, up to 20 employees in gumboots would
					run around the dock floor with nets, scooping up fish. Ship
					owners stood by and waited, unhappy that they were losing
					precious dock time and that sometimes hundreds of repair
					personnel were forced to remain idle.</p>
				<p>it came to a head about a year and a half ago when a ship docked at around
					11:30 p.m. When the water was pumped out, almost 150 salmon
					&mdash; at 20 to 25 kilos each &mdash; were splashing on the dock floor.</p>
				<p>PWGSC Dock Operator Bill Anderson recalls being told to put his hipwaders
					on. &quot;There were fish everywhere,&quot; he says. &quot;I've never seen
					so many. We were told to try to save the female coho salmon
					and we were there until four in the morning with all the
					repair work on hold.&quot;</p>
				<h2>A Creative Answer</h2>
				<div class="smallFont" style="font-weight:bold; float:left; padding-right:10px; width:200px;">
					<img src="../images/keeping-it-simple-2.jpg" alt="A curtain of air bubbles" width="200" height="238" /><br />
					A
					black pipe down the wall and a white pipe along the bottom
					of the Esquimalt Graving Dock release a curtain of air bubbles
					that prevent seals and fish from entering the dock with ships. </div>
				<p>Mr Anderson, who has a background in the pipeline industry, was asked
					to come up with a solution. His research revealed a bubble
					curtain that was used at some fish hatcheries and dams, and
					he adapted the concept for the graving dock. A long pipe
					was fitted to run down the 25 metre walls and across the
					floor. A series of holes,     about 60 centimetres apart,
					was drilled into the pipes and a pressure gauge fitted on top.</p>
				<p>Mr anderson said the project was an experiment and it earned him the nickname
					&quot;Bubble Boy.&quot; &quot;I got teased a lot. People told me they weren't
					sure it was going to work. I would answer, 'Neither am I.'
					&quot;</p>
				<p>But it did. As a ship approached, the turn of a handle forced air through
					the small holes, producing a curtain fo bubbles. The salmon
					turned away from it and the seals, curious by nature, were
					attracted by the oddity, but did not venture past it.</p>
				<p>Mr Lawes says they haven't had any complaints since they introduced the
					curtain. He says the real test will come this fall during
					spawning season when salmon return to the area, but he remains
					optimistic. And the final price tag for the cost-saving solution
					was only $700.</p>
				<p>&quot;This is a real success,&quot; says Wr Lawes. &quot;Everyone is pleased. Sometimes
					the best solutions are the simplest.&quot; </p>
