				<p>If you've ever travelled on an ocean liner when a stabilizer has malfunctioned
					you'll appreciate the value of this vessel feature.</p>
				<p>Stabilizers are located on cruise ships at mid-hull, below the water line,
					and are extended to provide additional stability and reduce
					the rolling motion of ships during voryage. They are hydro-dynamically
					designed and require regular maintenance and occasional repair.</p>
				<p>While crossing the Atlantic some years ago, aboard the Holland-America
					Line's <em>Maasdam</em>, something went wrong with one of the stabilizers
					- in quiet seas, and the ship suddenly tipped over to one
					side. I was lucky to get away without bruises but one or
					two passengers suffered broken bones.</p>
				<p>'Stabilizer pockets' - recesses built into the concrete walls of a graving
					dock to enable cruise ships to extend their stabilizers for
					inspections, maintenance and repairs while in dry dock -
					are now a feature of the Esquimalt Graving Dock (EGD) in
					Victoria, BC.</p>
				<p>The dock is a public facility operated by Public Works &amp; Government Services
					Canada, and is the largest non-military graving dock on the
					west coast of the Americas. Victoria's mild climate makes
					the location ideal for shipbuilding, repair and maintenance
					work. There is also an abundant supply of skilled labour.</p>
				<p>Staffed by 42 full-time federal employees, the actual work on the vessels
					that use the graving dock is contracted out to private companies,
					including work on federal and provincial government vessels.
					The staff operate the dock on a 24-hour, 365-day a year basis,
					supplying crane services, dock services, and air, power and
					water.</p>
				<p>&quot;We are literally an around-the-clock facility,&quot; says acting manager Bob
					desmarais. &quot;We even kept going during the severe snowstorm
					of '96. We have been really busy for the last six years,
					and currently have bookings up to 2005, mostly with ferries,
					but also with ocean liners, offshore fishing vessels, and
					government vessels.&quot;</p>
				<p>The graving dock was originally designed to accommodate the largest capital
					ships of the Royal Navy during the days when the British
					Empire covered much of the globe. Over its 70-year history,
					the facility has handled everything from steam-powered vessels
					to the largest of today's conventional ships.</p>
				<p>During World War 2 the dock was used for the refitting and conversion
					of the ocean-going liners to troopships, the most famous
					of which was the <em>Queen Elizabeth</em>. Today, the facility is
					capable of accomaditng and servicing more than 90 per-cent
					of all foreign and domestic vessels operating on the west
					coast.</p>
				<p>The dock is a popular location for repair and refit work for vessels engaged
					in the west coast cruise ship trade, for bulk and general
					cargo vessels plying the Pacific Rim, and for elements of
					the domestic fleet - especially the Royal Canadian Navy and
					the BC Ferry Corporation.</p>

				<em>Sun Princess</em> </div>
				<p>What size vessel can the graving dock handle?</p>
				<p>&quot;Victoria Shipyards recently worked on the 960-ft. long          ocean
					liner <em>Infinity</em> here, a vessel which required maintenance to its
					Mermaid propulsion units,&quot; says Bob.</p>
				<p>Over the past 10 years, the graving dock has experienced considerable
					expansion and modernization, including the construction of
					new 150 tonne and 30 tonne level luffing cranes, refurbishing
					of the dock's electrical and pumping infrastructure, and
					enclosing the dock on the south wharf.</p>
				<div class="smallFont" style="font-weight:bold; float:left; padding-right:10px; width:200px;"><img src="../images/first-registered-to-4.jpg" title="EGD's 150-tonne crane" alt="EGD's 150-tonne crane" width="200" height="315" /><br />
				EGD's 150-tonne crane </div>
				<p>The latest addition, the stabilizer pockets, were used for the first time
					by Victoria Shipyards and September of last year with the
					arrival of the <em>Sun Princess</em> of Princess Cruise Lines.</p>
				<p>&quot;We are extremely pleased with the addition of stabilizer pockets at the
					Esquimalt Graving Dock,&quot; says Malcolm Barker, Manager of
					Operation for Victoria Shipyards. &quot;It will help the shipbuilding
					industry attract new business as well as add value to our
					existing business.&quot;</p>
				<p>Esquimalt Graving Dock has been certified by Lloyds of London as being
					in compliance with the United States Military Standard 1625B
					(SH). It is now expected to achieve another important certification
					this September, the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System
					certificaiton.</p>
				<h2>ISO 14001 certification</h2>
				<p>Environmental responsibility has become a priority at the Esquimalt Graving
					Dock. The <acronym title="Esquimalt Graving Dock">EGD</acronym> has implemented an environmental Management
					System (EMS) based upon ISO 14001, the international standard
					for environmental management. The EGD is currently undergoing
					the audit process to become registered to the standard.</p>
				<p>&quot;I believe that we would be the first large industrial shipyard in North
					America to become registered to the ISO 14001 Standard,&quot;
					says Daryl Lawes, EGD's Environmental coordinator. &quot;Our program
					is generating interest from shipyards on the east coast,
					as well as the industry in Washington State and Norfolk,
					Virginia.&quot;</p>

				Spill training course </div>
				<p>The ISO Standard has provided the framework for the EGD to develop a management
					system to manage the environmental aspects of its operations.
					The EGD has worked closely with a number of ship repair firms
					to develop the system, including Victoria Shipyards, Esquimalt
					Drydock Company, Jenkins Marine, and Point Hope Shipyards,
					as well as clients such as BC Ferries and the Canadian Navy.</p>
				<p>&quot;From the very first stages of developing the system, we knew its success
					depended on the participation of the ship repair firms and
					ship owners,&quot; says Daryl. &quot;We have taken a cooperative approach
					and achieved the supportand buy-in of all the users.&quot;</p>
				<p>Here are some of the benefits of implementing the standard:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Increased Competitiveness</strong>. Many companies, particularly
						cruise lines and government fleets, want to be sure that
						the operations associated with their business are done
						in an environmentally responsible manner. Having their
						ships worked on in a facility with an <acronym title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</acronym> 14001 management
						system provides a level of confidence.</li>
					<li><strong>Environmetnal Protection</strong>. The system requires commitments
						and procedures for environmetnal protection, pollution
						prevention, and continual improvement.</li>
					<li><strong>Compliance Assuratnce</strong>. The system requires commitments to compliance
						with applicable regulations and regularly measures this
						compliance.</li>
					<li><strong>Waste Reduction</strong>. Cost savings are realized through
						the tracking and reduction of wastes generated.</li>
				</ul>

						EGD's air quality monitoring program </div>
						<strong>Development of Best Management Practices Manual</strong>. Through a series of
						workshops and meetings, a set of guidelines was developed
						to ensure that operations at the EGD were conducted in
						an environmentally responsible manner.</li>
					<li><strong>Air Quality / Noise Monitoring Programs</strong>. the EGD has
						implemented noise monitoring and particulate monitoring programs to ensure
						that activities commonly associated with ship maintenance
						and repair - such as sandblasting - are managed so as
						to mitigate any off-site impacts.</li>
					<li><strong>Environmental Awareness / Training Programs</strong>. An extensive
						training program has been developed so that employees and ship repair
						contractors are aware of their responsibilities for protecting
						the environment.</li>
					<li><strong>Environmental Blasting Equipment</strong>. The GED is promoting
						the use of advanced vacuum abrasive blasting equipment,
						which reduces the amount of particulate generated by 99 per-cent over conventional
						surface preparation methods and greatly reduces the amount
						of waste generated.</li>
					<li><strong>Stormwater Monitoring Program</strong>. Discharges from the
						dry dock and work areas are regularly monitored for pollutants.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Facts and figures on Esquimalt Graving Dock</h2>
				<p>The graving dock, with dimensions of 357 metres by 38.4 metres, is divisible
					into two sections through the insertion of an intermediate
					caisson gate. It is a monolithic concrete structure with
					granite blocks used the cope, quoins and three levels of
					the altars.</p>
				<p>Closure of the dock is by floating caissons ballasted with concrete and
					sea water. Watering and de-watering is through a main tunnel
					on the north isde.</p>
				<p>This tunnel connects to separate tunnels which enables each dock section
					to fill independently through culverts on the floor.</p>
				<p>The north landing jetty is 305 metres long and contains 10 metres of water
					depth at low tide. There is another 406 metres of berth frontage
					at the south landing wharf. In addition, there is ample open
					space available for fabrication and component assembly activities,
					if required.</p>
