					Lawes, environmental coordinator with Public Works and Governmetn
					Services Canada, demonstrates the bubble curtain at the vessel
					entrance to the Esquimalt Graving Dock. It's been a success
					on two fronts, he says &mdash; wildlife protection and the productivity
					of workers. <em>(Ray Smith/Times Colonist) </em></div>
				<p>Call it the high-tech bubble that hasn't burst.</p>
				<p>A pair of PVC tubes, compressed air, the practical use of ocean science
					and a little ingenuity have combined to save time, energy
					and plenty of money at the Esquimalt Graving Dock.</p>
				<p>The dock, owned by the federal government, has solved a major headache
					for its staff and the private shipyards who work at the facility
					with the installation of a curtain of air bubbles at the
					dock entrance.</p>
				<p>That curtain of air which can rise as high as 15.2 metres is what separates
					a smoothly running drydock with a dock fraught with delays
					and frustration because of stranded wildlife and fish.</p>
				<p>&quot;This curtain has been a huge benefit, a very successful initiative,&quot;
					said Malcolm Barker, general manager of Victoria Shipyards
					which leases space at the dock. &quot;This saves on the aggravation
					to the fish and the aggravation to us.</p>
				<p>&quot;It's good for my heart... because the delays were costly.&quot;</p>
				<p>The bubble curtain, the product of compressed air being pumped through
					a pair of strategically punctured 40-metre PVC tubes that
					run the width of the dock, acts like an imprenetrable wall
					to fish and seals.</p>
				<p>According to the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans, the keen
					eyesight of fish combined with their sensitivity to noise
					keeps them from the curtain.</p>
				<p>So when cruise ships, ferries and other vessels pull into the drydock
					for repairs, they do so alone. There are no fish or seals
					left behind when the water is drained to provide access to
					the ship's hulls, and therefore no delays to the work schedule
					because of the need to save lives.</p>
				<p>&quot;It has worked out really well,&quot; said Daryl Lawes, the environmental
					coordinator for Public Works and Government Services Canada,
					which runs the graving dock. &quot;For me it was a great relief to see that
					it worked because we're dealing with all kinds of factors
					&mdash; the health and safety of the guys and protecting the fish.&quot;</p>
				<p>From October 2002      when it was introduced until last week, there were
					no reports of stranded fish.</p>
				<p>it started with one tube, but was recently doubled after an incident last
					week when a few fish got through the curtain after the outer
					gate was open for an extended period during a high tide.
					And all this has been done for only $700.</p>
				<p>Stranded wildlife had been a problem for years at the dock, but came
					to a head last summer when about 130 salmon were left behind
					when the water was drained to start repairs on a large cruise
					ship.</p>
				<h2>Curtain: Workers had to save fish stranded as dock drained</h2>
				<p>&quot;You can imagine what a pain it is considering the length and width
					of the dock to be running around grabbing up fish, some of
					them as much as 50 pounds, in a foot and a half of water,&quot; said
					Lawes.</p>
				<p>That night the 40-metre wide and 250-metre long drydock &mdash; it's three metres
					wider than the Panama Canal &mdash; was filled with stranded fish
					and dockyard staff rushing to save them.</p>
				<p>It may have been a pain, but it was also a blow to the bottom line.</p>
				<p>Lawes' estimates from 2000-2002 show the graving dock lost $35,000 because
					of time spent rounding up and setting free the wildlife -
					that comes out to about 20 minutes a fish or $250 per salmon.
					Seals were more labour intensive as they had to be lured
					into a first-aid basket and lifted by a crane over the dock walls
					to freedom.</p>
				<p>But that price tag likely pales in comparison to what shipyards lost with
					idled workers.</p>
				<p>&quot;Basically we have to stop everything, and that's a real problem,&quot; said
					Barker, noting he has had between 200 and 500 workers sitting
					around for hours at any one time waiting for the dock to
					be cleared. &quot;When they're waiting to go to work at 5 p.m.
					[and it's pushed back to 8 p.m.] that's big bucks.&quot;</p>
				<p>The other problem is the cruise ships are on tight schedules.</p>
				<p>Barker says if it's booked for 112 hours, the captain is pulling it out
					in exactly 112 hours, meaning that shipyard has to work faster
					or pay more overtime.</p>
				<p>The idea for the bubble curtain was the brainchild of the meetings between
					Lawes and Fisheries and Oceans officials. Other ideas floated
					included drag nets and running an electric current through
					the space.</p>
				<p>&quot;Those other options were in the thousands of dollars and manpower with
				the use of all the boats,&quot; said Lawes. &quot;This was ideal.&quot;       </p>
