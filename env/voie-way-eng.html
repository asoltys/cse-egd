					Jim Milne (centre) and Environmental Coordinators, Daryl Lawes and Rae-Ann Shaw, on site at the Esquimalt Graving Dock.</div>When it comes to technology, most people think of machines. Pacific Region's
					Daryl Lawes and Rae-Ann Shaw also think about how <em>people</em> use the
					technology.
				<p>They are the Environmental Coordinators for the Esquimalt Graving Dock
					in British Columbia and they're working on <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr>&nbsp;14001 certification
					for Canada's largest dry dock. Says Lawes, &quot;It is an exciting
					project because we are the only large ship repair facility
					in the world who are working on <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr>&nbsp;14001.&quot; The certification
					should be in place by April&nbsp;2001.</p>
				<p><abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr>&nbsp;14001 is an internationally recognized standard for environmental
					management. Companies and government organizations put the
					system in place to minimize the environmental impact of their
					operations. Certification is a big job; in a multi-million-dollar
					operation like the Graving Dock, every process has to be
					examined for its environmental impact, then targets have
					to be set for reductions in the most important ones.</p>
				<p>Lawes and Shaw eventually determined that 17&nbsp;areas were the most significant
					and are now working on programs to address each one. Shaw
					explains, &quot;It is a huge undertaking because we have to look
					at contractor operations at the Dock, not just <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> operations.
					For example, air quality is a big issue because there is
					a lot of sandblasting at the Dock, but we don't do the blasting.
					The companies that work at the Dock do it.&quot; She emphasizes
					that <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr>&nbsp;14001 is more than just a manual, it is a whole
					system.</p>
				<p>Jim Milne manages the Graving Dock and gives the project full support.
					&quot;You have to recognize how ambitious it is to implement <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr>&nbsp;					14001 in such a complex, heavily industrialized facility,&quot;
					he says. &quot;The reason we seem to be the only one trying it
					is probably because it is such a huge job.&quot; Others are watching
					with interest, though. Calls have come from numerous local
					shipyards and from Halifax, Seattle and Virginia. Milne is
					also thankful for the support of key clients, including <abbr title="Department of National Defense">DND</abbr>,
					the Canadian Coast Guard and <abbr title="British Columbia">BC</abbr> Ferries.</p>
				<p>Lawes agrees that certification is an enormous job, but he thinks it makes
					good business sense. Environmental protection, of course,
					is the main benefit. The Dock is surrounded by residential
					areas and strives to be a good neighbour. Also <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr>&nbsp;14001
					will increase compliance assurance; that is, <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> will be
					better able to make sure that the Dock operations are in
					line with legal requirements.</p>
				<p>The environmental system also improves the Dock's competitiveness. Many
					shipping lines, especially cruise ship lines, want to use
					the most environmentally-friendly services. And, thanks to
					<abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>, the Esquimalt Graving Dock will be one of the best
					options.</p>
