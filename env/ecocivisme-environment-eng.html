				</div>
				<p>The Canadian General Standards Board has recently registered the Esquimalt
					Graving Dock, the largest fixed-foundation civilian dry dock
					on the West Coast of North America, to <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr>&nbsp;14001. Located
					in a suburb of Victoria, British Columbia, the dock is owned
					and operated by Public Works and Government Services Canada
					(PWGSC), but all the shipbuilding and repairs are done by
					private companies.</p>
				<p><abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr>&nbsp;14001 registration has come about because in&nbsp;1999 the dock's management
					and tenants agreed that an organized approach was necessary
					to address environmental issues associated with industry
					activities.</p>
				<p>Recognizing that the success of the project required the participation
					and support of a number of independent organizations, <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>
					began by forming an environmental committee of all the affected
					parties. The <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> staff persuaded the ship-repair firms
					that creating an <abbr title="Environmental Management System">EMS</abbr> was right for both moral and business
					reasons. Making this change in an industry centuries old
					and very conservative was a major accomplishment in itself.
					Once this had been achieved the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> environmental staff
					worked on designing a coherent <abbr title="Environmental Management System">EMS</abbr>.</p>
				<p>The proposed environmental management system took into account <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>'s
					unique situation of being the owner and operator of the
					dock, but not the ship-repair service provider. It gave operating
					protocols for all of the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> functions &ndash; providing water,
					steam, power, air as well as the physical facilities. In
					addition it included mechanisms to ensure that the dock's
					tenants repsected Esquimalt's environmental needs.</p>
				<p>To increase awareness and goodwill, the pre-audit training sessions provided
					to <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> employees were made available to all of the dock's
					tenants. This not only provided technical information to
					the people working on site, but also created a strong team
					spirit.</p>
				<p>The Canadian General Standards Board's August&nbsp;2001 audit focused primarily
					on two issues. One involved the division of activities between
					the facility operator (PWGSC) and the service providers,
					and the need for a dividing line between responsibility and
					influence to be clearly established. The other concerned
					the difficulty in defining the scope of the entity to be
					registered. It took an effort to produce a scope that encompassed
					the broad and somewhat diffuse structure at Esquimalt Graving
					Dock while keeping within the limits of <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>'s management
					control.</p>
				<p>Typcially an audit report identifies deficiencies. Only rarely does it
					include congratulations, but this was the case with the Esquimalt
					Graving Dock. The dock's management and tenants were applauded
					for their outstanding team effort, in producing a truly shared
					environmental management system.</p>
				<p>Achieving <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr>&nbsp;14001 regsitration demonstrates that <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> is a good corporate
					environmental citizen. The management discipline imposed
					by the standard will allow the staff to retain control over
					the environmental issues despite the consistently changing
					nature of the marine repair-business. The Esquimalt Graving
					Dock was one of the first federal organizations to meet the
					requirements of <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr>&nbsp;14001, and one of only three large shipyards
					in the world to achieve this designation.</p>
				<p>The Canadian General Standards Board extends its congratuations to the
					Esquimalt Graving Dock's management and tenants on achieving
					<abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr>&nbsp;14001 registration.</p>
